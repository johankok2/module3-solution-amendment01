    Government has launched its electronic vaccination data system (EVDS) for South Africa, allowing qualifying people to sign up for a Covid-19 vaccine. The EVDS system aims to assist in both the management and surveillance of the Covid-19 vaccine. Among other features, the EVDS will provide and track vaccine information, such as:
•	Patient information, including demographics and number of doses;•	Safety information – such as possible adverse events following immunisation;
•	Details of vaccine administration sites.In the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccine roll out only medical healthcare workers will be allowed to register, with the portal requiring users to enter their occupation, employer, whether they are patient-facing, and medical aid information before proceeding. Those who qualify will be sent a notification through SMS informing them of the time and place that the vaccine will be available. It will also come with a unique code that patients will be required to show to their vaccinator. Patients are also expected to provide their ID and a contact number when at the vaccination site. As part of this monitoring system, there are plans to send reminders for a follow-up appointment to receive a second dose and to include an integrated track-and-trace system for defaulters – those who do not show up to receive their second shot. A dashboard system is also being developed to capture the reasons given for vaccine refusal. As part of this process, the Department of Health has said that all South Africans who are vaccinated will be placed on a national register and provided with a vaccination card. In this regard, the department said that an electronic vaccination certificate will be available via the EVDS online platform once the second vaccine shot has been issued.
